### proj-mongoose

This is a POC for mongoose, but also for comparison to the node mongo driver. I.e. I have a sneaky suspicion that I would be faster and less constrained working in the node mongo driver. It would also reinforce my in-depth knowledge of the mongo client commands as the node driver's syntax remains equivalent. Mongoose wraps everything to the point to where you have to learn a whole new way of doing things. There's plenty of advantages to mongoose's rich api, just feels overly constrained and too far away from the mongo client that took so long to learn. I'm hoping to prove things one way or another. Maybe both are viable options? I'll update this doc when I get the results.
